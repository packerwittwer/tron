## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [Make more responsive music. Currently it just plays constantly while the program is running, but I want to add a sound for when there's a collision.]
* [Make a little sprite or something for the car instead of just having it be a square.]
* [Add a menu where you can choose 1 or 2 players, and if it's one player then the other player will be the computer.]
